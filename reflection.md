I consult Ayesha, Sumeiya, Anna and Jinki. I went to the Wednesday evening TA sessions. I think java need to type a lot more than python. It is confusing sometimes. And the format of python keep making me want to type the same in java. I only know that they are both object-oriented. Most of my code work for the first time. I just keep complete it afterwards.
